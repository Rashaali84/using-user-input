# Using User Input

Welcome.

This repository contains a whole bunch of mini-websites for you to study and practice developing.  Each one implements a single user story, and each one is organized the same way. The goal of these exercises isn't to create mind-blowing projects.

Instead the goal to get lots of practice navigating source code, debugging, and incrementally developing websites that handle user input with JavaScript.

There are 4 sets of exercises:

* [Fill in the Blanks](./1-fill-in-the-blanks)
* [Fix the Bugs](./2-fix-the-bugs)
* [Develop from Specifications](./3-develop-from-specifications)
* [Open-Ended](./4-open-ended)

And 3 helpful resources:

* [Completed Examples to Study](./0-completed-examples)
* [Stepped Madlibs Example](./stepped-madlibs)
* [Empty Boilerplate](./empty-boilerplate)
